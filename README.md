# üõí UK E-Commerce SQL Analysis Project

This project analyzes a real-world e-commerce transactional dataset using SQL. It is ideal for beginners learning SQL for data analysis, with a focus on filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, views, and performance optimization using indexes.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The dataset (`UK E-commerce`) contains records of customer purchases for a UK-based online retail store, with the following key columns:

- `InvoiceNo`: Transaction invoice number  
- `StockCode`, `Description`: Product identifiers and descriptions  
- `Quantity`: Number of items purchased  
- `InvoiceDate`: Date and time of purchase  
- `UnitPrice`: Price per item  
- `CustomerID`: Unique ID of the customer  
- `Country`: Customer's country

## üßπ Data Cleaning

To ensure analysis accuracy, invalid data entries were removed. This includes records with negative or zero quantities or prices, and null/missing descriptions or customer IDs.


SELECT * 
FROM [UK E-commerce]
WHERE 
  Quantity > 0
  AND UnitPrice > 0
  AND CustomerID IS NOT NULL
  AND Description IS NOT NULL

AND TRIM(Description) != '';

## üîç SQL Analysis
1. Top-Selling Products

SELECT Description, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalSold
FROM UK_Retail
GROUP BY Description
ORDER BY TotalSold DESC;

2. Sales After a Specific Date

SELECT * 
FROM UK_Retail
WHERE InvoiceDate >= '2011-09-01'
ORDER BY InvoiceDate;

##üîó Joins (Customer Info)
A mock CustomerInfo table was created to practice JOIN operations.

CREATE TABLE CustomerInfo AS
SELECT DISTINCT CustomerID, Country
FROM UK_Retail;
3. INNER JOIN - Country by Invoice

SELECT r.InvoiceNo, r.CustomerID, c.Country, r.Quantity, r.UnitPrice
FROM UK_Retail r
INNER JOIN CustomerInfo c ON r.CustomerID = c.CustomerID;

4. LEFT JOIN - Invoices with/without Country Info

SELECT r.InvoiceNo, r.CustomerID, c.Country
FROM UK_Retail r
LEFT JOIN CustomerInfo c ON r.CustomerID = c.CustomerID;

##üß† Subqueries & Aggregates
5. Customers Spending More Than Average


SELECT CustomerID, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSpent
FROM UK_Retail
GROUP BY CustomerID
HAVING TotalSpent > (
  SELECT AVG(Quantity * UnitPrice)
  FROM UK_Retail
);

6. Monthly Revenue Trend

SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', InvoiceDate) AS Month,
       SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS Revenue
FROM UK_Retail
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Month;

7. Average Quantity per Invoice

SELECT AVG(Quantity) AS AvgQuantity
FROM UK_Retail;

##üìä Views & Optimization
8. View for Top-Selling Products

CREATE VIEW Top_Products AS
SELECT Description, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalSold
FROM UK_Retail
GROUP BY Description
ORDER BY TotalSold DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT * FROM Top_Products;

9. Index Creation for Performance

CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON [UK E-commerce](CustomerID);
CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_date ON [UK E-commerce](InvoiceDate);

##üåç Country-Based Insights
10. Most Active Countries by Customer Count

SELECT Country, COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS TotalCustomers
FROM UK_Retail
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY TotalCustomers DESC;

11. Revenue per Product per Country

SELECT Country, Description, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS Revenue
FROM UK_Retail
GROUP BY Country, Description
ORDER BY Revenue DESC;
